# Geometry Dash Wrapper 0.9.7-newera1

Geometry Dash Wrapper runs selected historical Android Geometry Dash builds as native Windows desktop programs. It does not emulate Android as a complete operating system. The launcher reads an APK, selects a backend from the packaged native ABI, loads the original game library, and supplies the Android, JNI, Cocos2d-x, OpenGL, audio, network, input, and storage behavior that library expects.

No Geometry Dash APK, proprietary game library, save data, or compiled wrapper binary is included in this source package. You must supply a legally obtained compatible APK.

## What newera1 changes

- `Ctrl+V` pastes the complete Unicode clipboard into active game text fields. This covers level names, level descriptions/comments, search fields, account fields, and other fields that use the game's normal text-input path. Geometry Dash still applies its own character and length limits.
- The command prompt is hidden by default when launched through the supplied `.cmd` files. Set `SHOW_COMMAND_PROMPT=TRUE` while diagnosing startup or runtime problems.
- The guest render surface is configurable with `RESOLUTION=WIDTHxHEIGHT`. The new default is `1140x640`, exactly twice Geometry Dash's original 570x320 logical surface. The old fixed 1280x720 surface caused fractional scaling in early versions and could expose text-offset errors.
- `OLD_VER_PLAYTEST=TRUE` enables F5 in the legacy ARM editor. It calls the old game's own exported `EditorPauseLayer::onSaveAndTest` routine when that routine is present. It is off by default and does not fabricate game objects or use fixed function addresses.
- The retired comments-hotkey experiment remains removed. Pressing C has no wrapper-owned comments behavior.

## Architecture

`GeometryDashLauncher.exe` parses the APK ZIP directory and binary `AndroidManifest.xml`, records package/version metadata, picks a backend, creates the save and log paths, exports shared settings, and starts the backend.

| APK library found | Selected backend | Execution model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/x86/libcocos2dcpp.so` or `lib/x86/libgame.so` | `x86` | Direct 32-bit ELF loading and relocation on Windows |
| `lib/armeabi/libgame.so` | `arm-legacy` | ARMv5/Thumb execution through Dynarmic on a 64-bit Windows host |
| `lib/armeabi-v7a/libcocos2dcpp.so` | `armv7` | ARMv7/Thumb-2, VFP, and NEON execution through Dynarmic |

If an APK contains x86 and ARM libraries, the launcher prefers x86. The wrapper maps Android/JNI and libc calls into Windows implementations, translates OpenGL calls while preserving the guest viewport and scissor state, and keeps input coordinates aligned with the letterboxed content area.

This is a compatibility project, not a promise that every APK carrying one of those ABI paths will work. Old releases differ at the binary level. The legacy backend includes audited handling for the earliest `libgame.so` line, including the verified 1.0 binary. The ARMv7 2.2-beta path is intentionally narrow: a compatible selected late-2023 build can use its validated companion `LevelEditorLayerExt::initH`, while the unstable wrapper-owned reconstruction for stock 2019/2022/2023 editor stubs remains retired.

## Running an APK

Build first, then either:

1. Drag an APK onto `RUN_AUTO_GDPS.cmd` to use the configured GDPS server.
2. Drag an APK onto `RUN_AUTO_BOOMLINGS.cmd` to use the official Boomlings endpoint.
3. Put the APK beside the wrapper as `game.apk` and double-click either script.

The launcher identifies Geometry Dash, Lite, World, Meltdown, and SubZero package names for the window title and icon. Press F11 or Alt+Enter to switch between windowed and fullscreen modes. A resized window keeps the guest aspect ratio and maps mouse/touch coordinates back to the guest surface.

## Configuration

Edit the `set "NAME=value"` lines near the top of the two `RUN_AUTO_*.cmd` files.

| Setting | Supplied script default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GDPS_SERVER` | Script-specific | GD API host and base path. `RUN_AUTO_BOOMLINGS.cmd` uses `www.boomlings.com/database`; the GDPS script contains the private-server endpoint. |
| `HACK_ICONS` | `false` | Enables the supported icon-unlock patches. |
| `FULL_BYPASS` | `true` | Enables supported restriction/bypass patches for recognized builds. |
| `FORCE_HIGHEST_GRAPHICS` | `true` | Requests the highest packaged graphics tier. It is suppressed for the verified 1.0 legacy binary because that build crashes on the forced path. |
| `MUSIC_PULSE_MAX` | `0.30` | Clamps the music-derived pulse level from `0.0` to `1.0`. |
| `FPS` | `VSYNC` | `VSYNC` requests swap interval 1. A numeric value from `1` through `10000` disables VSync and uses the shared high-resolution host frame cap. Invalid values fall back to VSync. |
| `RESOLUTION` | `1140x640` | Guest render-surface width and height. Valid range: 320-7680 wide and 240-4320 high. Invalid values fall back to `1140x640`. |
| `SHOW_COMMAND_PROMPT` | `FALSE` | Hides the launcher console. Set `TRUE` to keep it visible for diagnostics. Boolean settings also accept yes/no, on/off, and 1/0. |
| `OLD_VER_PLAYTEST` | `FALSE` | On the legacy ARM backend, enables F5 in an active editor when the game's `EditorPauseLayer::create` and `onSaveAndTest` exports exist. |
| `VERSION_ISOLATED_SAVES` | `true` | Gives each package/version/backend combination its own save directory. Set `false` to use the shared `save` directory. |
| `EDITOR_CONTROLLS` | `true` | Enables legacy/x86 editor movement and rotation shortcuts. The historical misspelling is part of the public setting name. |
| `I_LOST_THE_GAME` | `true` | Launch guard set by the scripts. Direct backend execution without it shows the wrapper's launch message and exits. |

Advanced/internal settings:

- `V22_EXACT_EDITOR_VISIBILITY=TRUE` selects the complete companion visibility pass only on the validated late-2023 ARMv7 layout. It is not a general stock-beta fix.
- `GD_X86_API_CONNECT_MODE` is selected automatically for the x86 2.11 protocol path. It normally should not be overridden.
- `EXTRAS_MENU` is deliberately disabled in this branch even if an environment value is supplied.

### Resolution behavior

`RESOLUTION` controls the dimensions passed to the game's authentic `nativeInit`, not only the outer Windows window size. `1140x640` gives early 570x320 layouts an integer 2x render target and then lets the wrapper scale that image to the current client area. Other aspect ratios are allowed for compatibility testing, but they can change layout decisions made by the original game.

Command-line `--width=` and `--height=` arguments still override `RESOLUTION` when a Dynarmic backend is launched directly.

### Old-version playtest

With `OLD_VER_PLAYTEST=TRUE`, press F5 while the legacy ARM editor is active. The backend resolves these mangled exports from the loaded game at runtime:

```text
EditorPauseLayer::create(LevelEditorLayer*)
EditorPauseLayer::onSaveAndTest()
```

The verified Geometry Dash 1.0 ARM library contains both exports even though it has no modern inline editor-playtest implementation. F5 therefore uses the game's native save-and-test transition. If either symbol is absent, the wrapper logs `DYNARMIC_OLD_VER_PLAYTEST_UNAVAILABLE` and does nothing. This option currently targets the legacy ARM editor only and remains experimental until exercised in a Windows build.

## Keyboard and text input

| Context | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Gameplay | Space or Up presses/releases the player input. |
| Platformer gameplay on the supported ARMv7 beta | A/D or Left/Right move; Space or Up jumps. |
| Practice mode | Z places a checkpoint; X removes the last checkpoint where the loaded build exposes the required callbacks. |
| Legacy/x86 editor with `EDITOR_CONTROLLS=true` | W/A/S/D move selected objects; hold Shift for the small step; Q/E rotate. |
| Active text field | Normal Windows character input, Backspace, Enter, and Ctrl+V. Paste is converted from UTF-16 clipboard text to UTF-8 before entering the game's JNI text path. |
| Any game scene | Escape is translated to Android Back. |
| Window | F11 or Alt+Enter toggles fullscreen. |

ARMv7 editor shortcuts remain game/companion-owned so A/D can continue to work as platformer controls without the wrapper guessing editor ownership.

## Graphics and windowing

The wrapper creates a Win32 OpenGL window, forwards the guest's fixed-function rendering calls, tracks guest viewport/scissor rectangles, and rescales them into the letterboxed client area. DPI awareness is enabled so Windows display scaling does not introduce a second blurry stretch. Texture filtering is left to the game; an earlier forced-linear experiment was reverted.

The ARMv7 compatibility path retains the audited late-2023 ground/background bounds clamps and editor visibility/song-position behavior used by the supported companion build. It does not restore the retired host-built stock-beta editor.

## Audio

The shared Windows audio layer covers background music and effects without changing the original game assets:

- APK audio extraction and cache management;
- background playback and seek/replay behavior;
- asynchronous sound-effect playback;
- x86 FMOD-facing compatibility calls;
- per-wrapper software gain/mixer isolation so changing wrapper music volume does not alter the system-wide Windows mixer;
- custom-song metadata/download paths, including the official song endpoint fallback where required.

## Network and GDPS behavior

Known Geometry Dash API URLs, DNS targets, plaintext request lines, and Host headers can be rewritten onto `GDPS_SERVER` while preserving the endpoint path and query. The backends provide the socket/HTTP compatibility expected by their respective clients, apply bounded Windows network waits, and keep failed requests from permanently blocking the render loop. Official song metadata remains available as a targeted fallback instead of redirecting unrelated traffic.

The wrapper does not weaken HTTPS globally and does not bundle account credentials.

## Saves and logs

With the supplied scripts, saves are written below:

```text
save\{package}__v{version}__{backend}\
```

Setting `VERSION_ISOLATED_SAVES=false` writes to `save\` instead. The storage bridge maps Android writable paths into that directory, imports recognized legacy root `CC*.dat` files when safe, persists emulated preferences in `preferences.bin`, and commits game files through a temporary file plus write-through replacement.

Each launch gets a dated directory below `logs\`. It contains `run-info.txt`, the backend log, and—on Dynarmic backends—frame profiling/import diagnostics. `logs\latest-run.txt` points to the newest run directory. Use `SHOW_COMMAND_PROMPT=TRUE` and attach the newest log directory when reporting a launch failure.

## Building from source

Use a 64-bit Windows installation with PowerShell and Git available. The first build needs internet access for the pinned public tool/dependency downloads.

Run:

```bat
BUILD_ALL.cmd
```

Output is assembled in `dist-unified\` with the launcher, all three backends, run scripts, save directory, and icon assets. Individual entry points are also available:

- `BUILD_X86.cmd`
- `BUILD_DYNARMIC.cmd`
- `BUILD_LAUNCHER.cmd`

The Dynarmic build pins Zig 0.14.1, CMake 3.31.10, Ninja 1.13.2, Boost 1.84.0, and Dynarmic revision `a41c380246d3d9f9874f0f792d234dc0cc17c180`. Downloaded archives are checksum-verified. Build caches and tools remain local under `.build-tools` and `build-cache-windows`.

## Source layout

| `cmake`, `tools`, `build_*.ps1` | Reproducible Windows build orchestration and toolchain wrappers |

## Compatibility policy and engineering record

The active code follows observed ABI and binary behavior. Compatibility paths are keyed by library architecture, resolved exports, CRC/profile checks, validated object layouts, and instruction patches whose original bytes are checked before replacement. Unsupported capabilities fail closed and produce diagnostic results instead of being treated as present.

The abandoned 1.02 comments hotkey and the progressively reconstructed stock 2.2 editor were removed because runtime evidence did not support keeping them. The selected 2023 companion initializer, platformer input resolver, gameplay Edit callback, background/ground bounds checks, and frame pacing remain because their layouts and call paths were independently validated. Code comments are reserved for ABI constraints, compatibility traps, and other facts that are not apparent from the implementation.

## Known limitations

- The wrapper is Windows-only.
- It does not emulate a complete Android device or guarantee arbitrary APK/mod compatibility.
- The old-version F5 playtest is a native save-and-test transition, not a reconstructed modern inline playtest UI.
- Cursor hiding is intentionally not included; previous attempts were unreliable and the feature remains postponed.
- Stock/reduced 2019, 2022, and 2023 2.2-beta APKs without the compatible companion initializer do not gain a wrapper-built editor.
- A Linux source audit cannot replace runtime testing of the generated Windows binaries.
